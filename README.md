# <Horiseon Website Code Refactor>

## Description

I wanted to make the Horiseon Website more accessible to raise its position in search engines. At the same time, it obviously makes the site easier to use for a wider audience. Things like text contrast and proper nav bar links make the site overall cleaner as well! I learned to always keep an eye on your selectors in CSS. If multiple selectors are doing the same thing, the code is more difficult to understand. It becomes much easier to digest when it's written efficiently. Same goes for using semantic language in your HTML files.


## Usage

Click the nav bar items to be taken to useful information! You can also right-click in your browser and select inspect. Click the content selector button at the very top left of the new box that pops up, hover over any items, and check their accessibility criteria!


## Credits

Credit to Horiseon for creating the website and allowing me to refactor their code
